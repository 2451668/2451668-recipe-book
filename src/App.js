/* disclaimer - as per the brief I'll feature some commentary throughout the build. It might get a little wordy or redundant at times, but I feel for my own sake I'll need the context and annotations - to really understand what it is I'm doing. I've seen the CBO and I think I'll be revisiting this build a lot, it being our first proper submission and all. I understand if this leads to penalties in marking.  */
